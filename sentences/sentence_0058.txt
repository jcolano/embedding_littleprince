There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter.
The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house.
But he said to himself, nevertheless: "It may well be that this man is absurd.
But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler.
For at least his work has some meaning.
When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower.
When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep.

When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.
"Good morning.
Why have you just put out your lamp?"
"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter.
"Good morning."
