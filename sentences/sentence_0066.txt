"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
"That is possible.
Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
"One goes to see it?"
"No.
That would be too complicated.
But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."
The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
"But you--you come from far away!
You are an explorer!
You shall describe your planet to me!"
And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil.
The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil.
One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.
