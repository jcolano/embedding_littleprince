Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment.
Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.
And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.
Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But--what are you doing here?"
7And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please--draw me a sheep .
.
."
When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.
Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.
But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.
He answered me: "That doesn't matter.
Draw me a sheep .
.
."
