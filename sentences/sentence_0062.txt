"The one thing I love in life is to sleep."
"Then you're unlucky," said the little prince.
"I am unlucky," said the lamplighter.
"Good morning."
And he put out his lamp.
"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman.
Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous.
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."
He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: "That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend.
But his planet is indeed too small.
There is no room on it for two people.
.
."
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
3515 The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one.
