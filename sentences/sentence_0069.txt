And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
That was his first moment of regret.
But he took courage once more.
"What place would you advise me to visit now?"
he asked.
"The planet Earth," replied the geographer.
"It has a good reputation."
And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
3816 So then the seventh planet was the Earth.
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet!
One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men--that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.
Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle.
The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera.
First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia.
