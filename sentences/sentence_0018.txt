A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.
It spreads over the entire planet.
It bores clear through it with its roots.
And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces .

"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on.
"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care.
You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth.
It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is.
That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.
Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.
But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.
I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man.
