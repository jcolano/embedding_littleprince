."
And he gave me a sad smile.
I waited a long time.
I could see that he was reviving little by little.
"Dear little man," I said to him, "you are afraid .
.
."
He was afraid, there was no doubt about that.
But he laughed lightly.
"I shall be much more afraid this evening .
.
."
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable.
And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more.
For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
