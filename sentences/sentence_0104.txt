Then, after a silence, he went on: "I came down very near here."
And he flushed.
And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow.
One question, however, occurred to me: "Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you--a week ago--you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region?
You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
The little prince flushed again.
And I added, with some hesitancy: "Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?"
The little prince flushed once more.
He never answered questions--but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
"Ah," I said to him, "I am a little frightened--" But he interrupted me.
"Now you must work.
You must return to your engine.
I will be waiting for you here.
Come back tomorrow evening .
