I had let my tools drop from my hands.
Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death?
On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted.
I took him in my arms, and rocked him.
I said to him: "The flower that you love is not in danger.
I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep.
I will draw you a railing to put around your flower.
I will--" I did not know what to say to him.
I felt awkward and blundering.
I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.
It is such a secret place, the land of tears.
198 I soon learned to know this flower better.
On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple.
They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody.
One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away.
