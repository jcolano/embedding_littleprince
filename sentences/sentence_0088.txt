So the little prince tamed the fox.
And when the hour of his departure drew near-- "Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry."
48"It is your own fault," said the little prince.
"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you .
.
."
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.
"But now you are going to cry!"
said the little prince.
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.
"Then it has done you no good at all!"
"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields."
And then he added: "Go and look again at the roses.
You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world.
Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
