Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.
If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon.
Unfortunately, France is too far away for that.
But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps.

"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
And a little later you added: "You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad .

"Were you so sad, then?"
I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
But the little prince made no reply.
