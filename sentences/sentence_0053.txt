"Oh, no.
Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming.
As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence.
There is no time for idle dreaming in my life."
"Ah!
You mean the stars?"
"Yes, that's it.
The stars."
"And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?"
"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.
I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate."
"And what do you do with these stars?"
"What do I do with them?"
"Yes."
