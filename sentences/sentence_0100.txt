"Do you hear?"
said the little prince.
"We have wakened the well, and it is singing .
.
."
I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
"Leave it to me," I said.
"It is too heavy for you."

The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.
"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince.
"Give me some of it to drink .
.
."
And I understood what he had been looking for.
