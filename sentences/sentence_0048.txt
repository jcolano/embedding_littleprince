After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.
"And what should one do to make the hat come down?"
he asked.
But the conceited man did not hear him.
Conceited people never hear anything but praise.
"Do you really admire me very much?"
he demanded of the little prince.
"What does that mean--'admire'?"
"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
"But you are the only man on your planet!"
"Do me this kindness.
Admire me just the same."
"I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much?"
And the little prince went away.
"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
