"The orders are that I put out my lamp.
Good evening."
And he lighted his lamp again.
"But why have you just lighted it again?"
"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter.
"I do not understand," said the little prince.
"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter.
"Orders are orders.
Good morning."
And he put out his lamp.
Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
"I follow a terrible profession.
In the old days it was reasonable.
I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again.
I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
