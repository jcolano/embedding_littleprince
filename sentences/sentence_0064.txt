"That is very interesting," said the little prince.
"Here at last is a man who has a real profession!"
And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer.
It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
"Your planet is very beautiful," he said.
"Has it any oceans?"
"I couldn't tell you," said the geographer.
"Ah!"
The little prince was disappointed.
"Has it any mountains?"
"I couldn't tell you," said the geographer.
"And towns, and rivers, and deserts?"
36"I couldn't tell you that, either."
"But you are a geographer!"
"Exactly," the geographer said.
