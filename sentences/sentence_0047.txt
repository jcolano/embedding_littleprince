he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.
For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
"Good morning," said the little prince.
"That is a queer hat you are wearing."
"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied.
"It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me.
Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."
"Yes?"
said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.
"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
The little prince clapped his hands.
The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.
28"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself.
And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other.
The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
