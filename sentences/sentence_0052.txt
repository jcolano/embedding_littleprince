repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.
The businessman raised his head.
"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times.
The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where.
He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition.
The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism.
I don't get enough exercise.
I have no time for loafing.
The third time--well, this is it!
I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions--"
31"Millions of what?"
The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.
"Millions of those little objects," he said, "which one sometimes sees in the sky."
"Flies?"
"Oh, no.
Little glittering objects."
