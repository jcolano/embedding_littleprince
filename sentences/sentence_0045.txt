"Yes," said the little prince, "but I can judge myself anywhere.
I do not need to live on this planet.
26"Hum!
Hum!"
said the king.
"I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat.
I hear him at night.
You can judge this old rat.
From time to time you will condemn him to death.
Thus his life will depend on your justice.
But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily.
He is the only one we have."
"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death.
And now I think I will go on my way."
"No," said the king.
