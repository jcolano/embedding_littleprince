"What must I do, to tame you?"
asked the little prince.
"You must be very patient," replied the fox.
"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass.
I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing.
Words are the source of misunderstandings.
But you will sit a little closer to me, every day .
.
."
The next day the little prince came back.
"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox.
"If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy.
I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances.
At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about.
I shall show you how happy I am!
