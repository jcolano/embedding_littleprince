But I had never drawn a sheep.
So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.
It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.
And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, "No, no, no!
I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Draw me a sheep."
So then I made a drawing.
He looked at it carefully, then he said: "No.
This sheep is already very sickly.
Make me another."
So I made another drawing.
My friend smiled gently and indulgently.
