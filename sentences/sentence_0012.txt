I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope.
That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration.
But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
Grown-ups are like that .

.
Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.
So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.
And this time everybody accepted his report.
If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways.
When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.
They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like?
What games does he love best?
