It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.
It said: "If you please--draw me a sheep!"
"What!"
"Draw me a sheep!"
I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.
I blinked my eyes hard.
I looked carefully all around me.
And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.
Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.
But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
That, however, is not my fault.
The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
