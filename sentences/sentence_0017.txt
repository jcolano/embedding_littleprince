"But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!
", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident.
And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants.
In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants.
But seeds are invisible.
They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.
Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun.
If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish.
But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.

The soil of that planet was infested with them.
