the little prince asked.
"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand," said the switchman.
"I send off the trains that carry them: now to the right, now to the left."
And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.
"They are in a great hurry," said the little prince.
"What are they looking for?"
"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.
"Are they coming back already?"
demanded the little prince.
"These are not the same ones," said the switchman.
"It is an exchange."
"Were they not satisfied where they were?"
asked the little prince.
"No one is ever satisfied where he is," said the switchman.
