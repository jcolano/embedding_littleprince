I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore.
I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink.

"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said.
"Now you can go back home--" "How do you know about that?"
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.
He made no answer to my question, but he added: "I, too, am going back home today .
