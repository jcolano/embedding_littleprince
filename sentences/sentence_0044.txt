"We do not know that," the king said to him.
"I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom.
I am very old.
There is no room here for a carriage.

"Oh, but I have looked already!"
said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet.

"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered.
"that is the most difficult thing of all.
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others.
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
