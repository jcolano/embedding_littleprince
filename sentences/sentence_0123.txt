At one time I say to myself: "Surely not!
The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully .
.
."
Then I am happy.
And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough!
On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night .
.
."
And then the little bells are changed to tears .
.
.
Here, then, is a great mystery.
For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has--yes or no?--eaten a rose .
