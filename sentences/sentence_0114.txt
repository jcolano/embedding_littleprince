And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night .
.
.
You--only you--will have stars that can laugh!"
And he laughed again.
"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me.
You will always be my friend.
You will want to laugh with me.
And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure .
.
.
And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!
Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!'
And they will think you are crazy.
It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you .
