3 The Little Prince written and illustrated by Antoine de Saint Exupéry translated from the French by Katherine Woods TO LEON WERTH I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up.
I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world.
I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children.
I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.
He needs cheering up.
If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew.
All grown-ups were once children--although few of them remember it.
And so I correct my dedication: TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
41 Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
Here is a copy of the drawing.
In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.
And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.
