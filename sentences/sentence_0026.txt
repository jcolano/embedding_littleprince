Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important?
Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums?
And if I know--I, myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh!
You think that is not important!"
His face turned from white to red as he continued: "If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.
He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there .
.
.'
But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened .
.
.
And you think that is not important!"
He could not say anything more.
His words were choked by sobbing.
The night had fallen.
