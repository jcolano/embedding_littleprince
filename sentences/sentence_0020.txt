Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life .
.
.
For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset.
I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: "I am very fond of sunsets.
Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
"But we must wait," I said.
"Wait?
For what?"
"For the sunset.
We must wait until it is time."
At first you seemed to be very much surprised.
And then you laughed to yourself.
You said to me: "I am always thinking that I am at home!"
Just so.
