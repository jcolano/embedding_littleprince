Does he collect butterflies?"
Instead, they demand: "How old is he?
How many brothers has he?
How much does he weigh?
How much money does his father make?"
Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.
12If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.
You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000."
Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"
Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep.
If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."
And what good would it do to tell them that?
They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.
But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
They are like that.
